## Task description

### Challenge Dataset
The dataset provided for this challenge can be downloaded at no cost on the Ocean Market ( Polygon Network) by accessing the following link: https://bit.ly/dimitra-p2.

It provides crop yield data for soybean in the 46 districts of the Madhya Pradesh State, India for a period of 10 years, between 2010-2019.

It also provides MODIS satellite data for the same 10 year period, for the months June - November, for the following features:
    NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    LAI: Leaf Area Index
    ET: Evapotranspiration
    LST: Land Surface Temperature
    RF: Rainfall
    
Note: The soybean crop duration in Madhya Pradesh is from June to November hence the data extracted for the variables is from June to November month.
